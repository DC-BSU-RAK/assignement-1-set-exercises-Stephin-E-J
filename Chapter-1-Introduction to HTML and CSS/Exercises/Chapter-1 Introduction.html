    <h2> Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the crispy onions by heating up
            the oil in a saucepan over a medium high heat and 
            frying the sliced onions in batches until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Next, marinate your chicken by adding the chicken, 
            1/3 of the crispy onions, yoghurt, chilli powder, 
            turmeric, garam masala, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, 
            one cinnamon stick, 8 cardamom pods, 1 green chilli sliced 
            thin, 1 tsp cumin seeds, 4 cloves, chopped mint and coriander 
            and a tsp of salt in a large pot. Mix well and marinate for 
            4-24 hours.</li>
        <li>With the rice, rinse it twice then soak it in water for 40 minutes</li>
        <li>In a large pot, half filled with water, add 1 tbsp salt, 
            1 green chilli sliced lengthways in half, 6 green cardamom, 
            1 cinnamon stick, 2 cloves and 1 tsp cumin seeds and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked rice to the simmering water, stir once and cook for 
            6-8 minutes or until its just cooked. You still want a bit of bite in the rice.</li>
        <li>Remove the rice from the water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the marinated chicken onto a high heat and cook for 6-7 minutes, 
            stirring every 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove half of the chicken, then sprinkle half of the rice on the chicken in the pot.</li>
        <li>Next, add a layer of the crispy onions, some mint and coriander.</li>
        <li>Place the rest of the chicken and repeat with the rice, crispy onions and herbs.</li>
        <li>Place a clean tea towel over the lid of the pot and cover the biryani.</li>
        <li>Turn your element to medium high for 10 minutes, then turn it down to very 
            low for 30 minutes. Take from the heat and let it rest for 20 minutes before 
            taking the lid off and serving</li>
